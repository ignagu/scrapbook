			<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/2MqaBF0">Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World â€“ and Why Things Are Better Than You Think</a></h2>
			
				<p>I stumbled upon this book at the airport in Gothenburg, Sweden. Little did I know that it was written by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w">Ted Talk</a> super star (and I don't care) and that it would change my mindset ever since.</p>

				<p>Are you convinced that the World and humanity are a total failure? Are you 100% sure that at any moment a terrorist attack is going to take place during your morning commute? You're just like me a year ago before I read this book. 

				<p> How can we live our lives in peace if every step we take is conditioned by an idea made by our minds and our collective social imagination? I have an engineering degree and I should have known better from the start. Hans taught me that we must let the numbers to the talking and then convince our minds based on facts how it should or shouldn't feel about our World.</p>

				<p><a href="http://factfulnessquiz.com/">Take this test</a> - If you feel like it, let me know how you scored. And don't be ashamed if your score sucks, later on you'll find out highly educated people (we're talking PhDs and s###...) score even worse than monkeys. <a href="https://amzn.to/2MqaBF0">Read the book.</a>regardless of your result</p>

				<p><em>Thank you Hans Rosling</em></p>
