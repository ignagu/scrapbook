			<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/2MqaBF0">Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World â€“ and Why Things Are Better Than You Think</a></h2>
			
				<p>I stumbled upon this book written by written by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w">Ted Talk</a> super star Hans Rosling at the airport in Gothenburg, Sweden. Little did I know that it would change my mindset for good.</p>

				<p>Are you convinced that the World and humanity are a total failure? Are you 100% sure that at any moment a terrorist attack is going to take place during your morning commute? You're just like me before I read this book.</p>

				<p> How can we live our lives in peace if every step we take is conditioned by an idea made by our minds and by our collective social imagination? I have an engineering degree and I should have known better from the start. Hans taught me that we must let the numbers do to the talking and then convince our minds based on facts how it should or shouldn't feel about our World.</p>

				<p><a href="http://factfulnessquiz.com/">Take this test</a> - If you feel like it, let me know how you scored. And don't be ashamed if your score sucks, later on you'll find out highly educated people (we're talking PhDs and s###...) score even worse than monkeys. Also, whether you anwser right or wrong, try to understand why you think in a certain manner.Then, <a href="https://amzn.to/2MqaBF0"> read the book</a> regardless of your score. Finally, thank me later.</p>

				<p>Rosling is also the co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation. He developed this awesome tool called Trendalyzer with his son Ola & daughter in-law Anna Rosling. It enables visualizing data compiled by the UN and helps to understand our World</p>
